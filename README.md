**Objective:** Predicting whether a user will churn after the subscription expires.

**Client:** KKBOX is Asia's leading music streaming service, holding the world's most comprehensive Asia-Pop music library with over 30 million tracks, supported by advertising and paid subscriptions. Currently, the company uses survival analysis techniques to determine the residual membership life time for each subscriber. By adopting different methods, KKBOX anticipates they'll discover new insights to why users leave so they can be proactive in retaining users.

**Data:** For this analysis, I will be using the KKBox's churn prediction dataset which was publicly available on Kaggle.
